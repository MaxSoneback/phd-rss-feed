Our main research focus is on the vehicle as part of the wider transport system, taking into account requirements set on all system levels. The Centre collects a broad competence within the fields of vehicle concepts, lightweight structures, sound and vibrations, vehicle aerodynamics, rail vehicle technology and road vehicle dynamics.

The Centre for ECO2 Vehicle Design is a close collaboration with the Swedish based vehicle industry and more information regarding the Centre and the partners can be found at www.eco2vehicledesign.kth.se.

Job description


The Centre for ECO2 Vehicle Design is now seeking a Post Doctor within the field of modelling transient cooling in vehicles.

In passive convective cooling of electrical components on vehicles, both the temperature of the component to be cooled and the cooling effect of the flow are often coupled through the operational characteristics of the vehicle. This interaction is transient and load cycle dependent, as the temperatures of the component and the flow vary continuously, and so are not stationary for a given vehicle speed. In addition to this transient coupling of heating and cooling, there is also a spatial coupling when components are placed downstream of another. As the air cools one component, its temperature rises, and it becomes less effective as coolant for subsequent downwind components.

The project will focus on developing models that can be used to explore transient effects and dynamic coupling between the heat source and sink within the context of rail vehicle operation. First, a model for the coupling the heat generation and convective cooling during vehicle operation will be developed. This will be done using available data for specific components of interest and operational loads cycles. Then, the dynamics of this coupling will be explored to identify under which conditions vehicle motion cooling cannot provide sufficient cooling. 
This could be used, for example, to avoid driving behaviours that lead to heat build-up. The combination of multi-stage sequential cooling will also be explored to understand under what environmental and operational conditions certain components may be at risk of overheating. This research will improve planning layouts of components and/or thermal management in novel vehicle constructions.

Ã„mnesbeskrivning

Ã„mnet arkitektur med inriktning mot grundlÃ¤ggande gestaltning omfattar dels kunskaper som avser byggande och gestaltning av den fysiska miljÃ¶n, sÃ¤rskilt inredning, byggnader, landskap och stÃ¤der och samspelet mellan dem, dels kunskaper om omrÃ¥dets historiska och samtida betydelse fÃ¶r samhÃ¤llsutvecklingen i olika geografiska och kulturella sammanhang. Ã„mnet inbegriper en fÃ¶rdjupning i grundlÃ¤ggande gestaltning av byggnader och rum, samt rumsliga och materiella designverktyg och begrepp som mÃ¶jliggÃ¶r en fÃ¶rstÃ¥else fÃ¶r och en utveckling av arkitekturÃ¤mnet och dess arbetsprocesser.

Arbetsuppgifter

Som vikarierande adjunkt kommer man huvudsakligen att arbeta som lÃ¤rare i de kurser som ges i arkitekturprojekt inom utbildning pÃ¥ grundlÃ¤ggande nivÃ¥, Ã¥rskurs 1.

Increased digitization makes us increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks, where computers are compromised by malicious actors in order to cause damage and disruption. The higher the degree of digitization, the more devastating the potential attacks.

In order to mitigate cyber threats, vulnerabilities first need to be identified. This is generally very difficult, because it requires (i) a detailed understanding of the system architecture, and (ii) significant security expertise. The task can be significantly facilitated by dedicated engineering tool support in the form of threat modeling and attack simulation. Threat modeling supports requirement no 1 by documenting the design of the system architecture. Attack simulation supports requirement no 2 by automating the identification of vulnerabilities.

The main goal with this work is to develop threat modeling and attack simulation approaches. Programming skills are required, and skills or interest in ethical hacking is encouraged.

The Division of Network and Systems Engineering (Department of Computer Science) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology does research and education in cyber security, threat modeling, attack simulations, ethical hacking, and management of large scale complex IT environments. The division currently has ten faculty members, ten post docs, and about 20 PhD students.

We are offering a two-year doctoral position at the Division of Network and Systems Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

What we offer 

 -  International workplace.
 - A leading technical university that creates knowledge and expertise for a sustainable future.

The Division of Network and Systems Engineering at the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science is conducting research relating attack graphs as a means to analyze the security posture of computer systems. Attack graphs are formal (often probabilistic) models over potential attack vectors in systems that encodes the difficulty of succeeding with attacks given various system conditions and defense mechanisms. Our research is largely devoted to developing various solutions for automating the generation of attack graphs. This includes for instance languages and formal methods for attack graph generation, automatic attack process mining through sensors and system indicators, data-driven attack graph tuning (based e.g. on threat intelligence), and optimization/self-learning techniques for secure design under economic and technical constraints.

The research results aim to support both security engineers working in contexts of Security Operation Centers (SOC) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) as well as in more tactical development and maintenance projects. We work closely organizations in the critical infrastructure domain, in particular the power sector, as well as the defense sector. We are involved in several national and international research projects and programs, including two H2020 projects.Â Â Â Â

Much of the research is conducted within EU projects, as well as within the inter-departmental centers CAS and ACCESS Linnaeus Centre. The group has also strong financial support from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, the Knut och Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.

Job description

We invite applications for up to two postdoctoral research positions in the general field of hybrid control for robotic systems. The successful candidates will join a research group that is focusing on new control design methodologies for hybrid systems combining tools from control theory, reinforcement learning and formal verification methodologies from computer science. The position is associated with the following sub-topics:

- Distributed control synthesis from temporal logic specifications: develop control design tools for multi-agent systems to fulfill specifications given as temporal logic formulas from formal verification. In order to combine distributed control with formal methods, discrete abstractions of the distributed multi-agent system should be derived and agent dependencies should be accounted for.

- Human-in-the-loop robot control: A hybrid systems approach to the problem is considered where the human provides logical specifications to the robotic system that are translated to continuous control commands. The interaction is bidirectional in the sense that the human should update the input specification and the robotic system should adapt its feedback control in a real-time manner using reinforcement learning approaches.

- Multi-robot coordination and manipulation: develop control and task planning methodologies for heterogeneous multi-robot systems with different motion and manipulation capabilities. The robots may have different dynamics, state and input constraints and might or might not be equipped with manipulators for grasping and transportation objectives.

It is expected that the successful candidates will conduct research in the aforementioned research area, interact with doctoral and master students, and be involved in collaborative work in national and international projects. The position is associated to the NTU-WASP joint project Scalable Multi-Robot Sensor Fusion, Localization, Navigation, and Control, as well as the SSF Smart System project COIN,Â related to the topics discussed above.

Qualifications

Requirements

 - A doctoral degree or an equivalent foreign degree, obtained within the last three years prior to the application deadline.

Candidates should have a doctoral degree related to at least one of the following research areas:

- hybrid control systemsÂ 

- distributed multi-robot control

- formal methods for robot control synthesis

- learning-based multi-robot control.

The successful applicants should have an outstanding research and publication record. Well-developed analytical and problem solving skills are a requirement. We are looking for strongly motivated persons, who are able to work independently, as well as within a research group. Excellent command of English orally and in writing is required.

In addition, previous participation in EU project research and management, proposal writing skills, as well as experience with real robotic platforms will be considered a merit.

Great emphasis will be placed on personal competence and suitability.

The project is part of a larger Swedish-German collaboration within the RÃ¶ntgen-Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Cluster which aims at developing a sample environment in terms of a miniature AM machine for selected electron beam melting (SEBM). This provides a unique opportunity to study materialsâ€™ behavior during SEBM in-situ for the first time using X-rays generated at large-scale infrastructures (LSIs).

The final AM microstructure is determined by a complex interplay between the alloy characteristics, powder properties and printing parameters. The material is locally melted and solidified multiple times, as new layers are deployed on the underlying layers and is then exposed to cyclic heating and cooling throughout the rest of the printing time. This results in complex time-temperature relations in three dimensions. To understand the behavior of materials during AM, both post-print ex-situ characterization of printed parts and in-situ characterization during the process are needed.

The Unit of Structures at the department of Materials Science and Engineering offers a two-year postdoctoral position within the topic SEBM with focus on LSI sample environment development. The successful candidate will work in an international project team and will be based primarily in Stockholm but should be prepared to spend periods of time in Gothenburg and Hamburg.

Furthermore, the applicant will take part in teaching activities such as LSI course development and co-supervision of PhD and Master students.

What we offer 

 -  International workplace.
 - A leading technical university that creates knowledge and expertise for a sustainable future.
 - Here you get colleagues with high ambitions in an open, curious and dynamic environment.
 - A multidisciplinary and motivated team in the research fields materials design, AM and advanced characterization.
 - Help to relocate and be settled in Sweden and at KTH

Qualifications

Requirements

 - A doctoral degree or an equivalent foreign degree, obtained within the last three years prior to the application deadline, in materials science, engineering physics or related topics relevant to the project.
